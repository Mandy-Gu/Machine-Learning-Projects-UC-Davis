# Machine-Learning-Projects-UC-Davis
## Introduction:
The followings are 2 Machine Learning projects done within UC Davis courses

__Project 1: Build a classification model to predict who will have an income of more than 50k__
1. Conduct exploratory data analysis by data visualization
2. Balance the dataset by SMOTE
3. Select important features through the use of decision tree and run a logistic regression on the data with an AUC of 88%

__Project 2: Leverage Natural Language Processing Techniques to predict the rating of an online review__
1. Preprocess data by handling negation, stemming and stopwords
2. Create Bag Of Words (BoW) to represent each review
3. Run Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to do dimension reduction
4. Detect the similarity between two reviews by calculating the Eucolidean distance of both reviews based on the PCA result
5. Perform a lasso logistic regression embedded with BoW to predict the rating for a review
